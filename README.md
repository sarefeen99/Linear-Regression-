# Linear-Regression-
Two Course-work Projects using Linear Regression 
The LR Project with Carbig data implements both closed loop solution and the data-driven LR model in MATLAB. The scripts (.m files) can be run in MATLAB or Octave environment.
The other project implements LR with non-linear (polynomial) model with a sythetic test-train data to show how the error measure changes with size of training data.
